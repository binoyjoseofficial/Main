The root-level information about an identity must be available in a datastore, functioning as the index page for all associated data elements. This datastore acts as a facade for various data sources, media assets, value assets, NFTs, data services, business services, IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, validator services, marketplaces, and everything else related to the identity or business.

The bank is reliable and dependable. All services, data, or products offered by the identity can be authenticated and verified through the bank or the hierarchy of banks owned by the identity. In certain scenarios, an identity and a DAO can co-own a bank, requiring mutual agreement to make any changes to the bank.

Programs and computers can directly access and interact with the store programmatically.
The data in the store can be publicly viewable unless encrypted.
The bank can translate data from ID elements using custom ID translators. For example, you can provide an ENS identifier for an account. Bank operators can use the ENS API to resolve the identifier into an EVM address.

The bank also offers a URL-based naming convention. For instance: **DallasSales.acme/Bank**
You can store personal certificates, awards, or other achievements in the bank. Airdrop programs and rewards programs can query the store, validate certificates using the Certificate Store, and process rewards only if the certificate is valid.

For certain use cases, you may also store real-world data in the ID store. For instance, it could include the medical history of a cow or a dog.
 

The root-level information of an identity should reside in a datastore. Imagine an index page for all associated data in your life - that is a good way to understand the bank. This datastore acts as a gateway to various resources, including data sources, media assets, value assets, NFTs, data services, business services, IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, validator services, marketplaces, and other elements linked to the identity or business.

The bank is designed to be both reliable and trustworthy. All services, data, and products associated with the identity can be authenticated and verified through the bank or its hierarchical structure. In certain cases, a bank can be co-owned by an identity and a DAO, with changes requiring mutual agreement.


Programs and computers can programmatically access and interact with the store, enabling seamless integration.

Unless encrypted, the data within the store is publicly viewable.

The bank can also translate ID data using custom ID translators. For example, you could provide an ENS identifier for an account, which bank operators can resolve into an EVM address via the ENS API.

Each bank supports a URL-based naming system, such as **DallasSales.acme/Bank**, making it easy to reference.

The bank can store personal records such as certificates, awards, or achievements. Airdrop and rewards programs can query the store, validate certificates using the Certificate Store, and process rewards only if the certificates are valid.

Additionally, real-world data can be stored in the ID store for specific use cases. For example, the medical history of a cow or a dog can be securely maintained and accessed as needed.

Imagine you have an RWA tokenâ€”each RWA token can be associated with its own dedicated bank or a hierarchy of banks.

The bank itself acts as a passive component, while the programs and databases registered within it can deliver advanced services to anyone in the ecosystem.

The bank is designed to be interoperable.

Its information is replicated across systems, anchored to the blockchain with proofs, enabling verification even off-chain.
