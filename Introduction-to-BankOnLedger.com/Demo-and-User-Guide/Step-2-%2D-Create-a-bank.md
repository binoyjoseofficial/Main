### Open Wallet

Bank operations are available through the BankOnLedger wallet. Let’s start by opening the wallet.

### Home

When you reach the wallet’s home screen, you'll find several options under the "Create Bank" section.
Choose the option that best suits your needs. The recommended option is "Fancy Bank Service," which includes website theming.

If your wallet is linked to a company, some features may be overridden by the company’s settings. In that case, the "Create Bank Templates" will be provided by your company, and you should follow their guidelines.
