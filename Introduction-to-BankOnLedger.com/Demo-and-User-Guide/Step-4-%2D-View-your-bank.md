# View Bank
Once youâ€™ve edited and saved your bank, anyone can view it using a url.

The bank associated with the root identity can always be accessed at **{identity-name}.BankOnLedger.com**

Alternatively, you can visit BankOnLedger.com and search for your identity URL.

The bank page will look like the image below, and anyone can view it if they know the identity. Keep in mind that everything on the site is customizable.
