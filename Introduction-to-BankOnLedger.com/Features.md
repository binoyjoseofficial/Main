As an individual or business, your identity must reveal certain data points to the world.
A decentralized data store is essential to manage references to key data elements within an ID system. This ID data store should feature a standardized data structure, an API interface accessible by programs and computers, and a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to review and interact with the stored data. It should also provide tools for editing the data and offer a clear, predictable path to verify the source of truth.

An ID data store functions much like a bank. Others can interact with your "bank" for transactionsâ€”such as transferring information in or out. Similar to storing certificates or awards in a bank vault, the data in an ID store can be securely stored and made accessible or editable by others with your permission. **BankOnLedger** introduces features akin to a decentralized bank, empowering users with advanced data storage and management capabilities.

# Key Features
------------

### **A Data Store**

Under your identity, you can create one or more "banks," each tailored for specific purposes or generic use cases. Examples include:
1.  A bank exclusively for BTC-related activities
2.  A bank dedicated to AWS-related business
3.  A bank for displaying hackathon certificates


Remember, we dont often store the data itself on the store - instead the links.

### **Verifiable**

You may verify that the information is logged by the identity owner. This authenticity can be easily confirmed through blockchain transaction records.

### **Hierarchical**

Your "banks" can be organized under sub-identities, creating a structured hierarchy.

### **Source of Truth**

The blockchain ensures the data registered with the bank is verified and authenticated by trusted participants.

### **Multi-Signature Support**

Banks can be managed by multiple individuals or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), ensuring collaborative ownership.

### **Custom Design**

Each bank can feature a unique web theme for personalization.

### **Encryption**

Banks can also be encrypted, ensuring that data remains secure and accessible only to authorized parties.
